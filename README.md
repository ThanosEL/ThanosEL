## 🧭 Who am I

I work close to the core of systems — where infrastructure, automation and security intersect.
Curiosity drives the process. Discipline keeps it safe.

---

## 🕶️ Current Focus

* Cloud infrastructure & Linux environments
* Servers, web services & monitoring
* Network operations & automation
* Security-aware system design

*(AWS & Azure IaaS, scripting, hardening, observability)*

---

## ⚡ Interests

* Offensive & defensive security research
* Privacy, anonymity & threat modeling
* Linux internals & automation
* Fitness, nature & long walks away from screens

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Boundary

All security-related work is conducted **only** in authorized, isolated environments.
Knowledge is used to understand, defend and improve systems — never to harm.

---

## ⚙️ Operating Principles

* Observe before acting
* Isolate before testing
* Automate what repeats
* Document what matters
* Respect the system — and the law

---

> The system isn’t broken.
> It’s just waiting to be understood.
